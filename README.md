# The Leaking Problem

The Leaking Problem This issue is occurring because apparently the
[porsager/postgres library](https://github.com/porsager/postgres) keeps
asynchronous operations in memory without completing them. This may be causing
the [Deno test runner library](https://deno.land/std@0.212.0/testing/bdd.ts) to
fail during assertion.

But, the postgres driver library develop by denodrivers team works fine. You can
see the test passing with this library in the branch `pg_driver_by_denodrivers`.

To test this project, make sure you have [Deno](https://deno.land/) and
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

1. Build the PostgreSQL database with:

   ```bash
   deno task db:build
   ```

2. Run the test with:

   ```bash
   deno task test
   ```

`sanatizers` can be activated by setting true.

```

3. To completely remove the PostgreSQL database, run:

   ```bash
   deno task db:remove
   ```

_Bonus_: if you are on Linux, run `deno task docker:print` to view your Docker
objects.
